# PowerCompile
PowerCompile is a Folder compiler for Powershell and Batch / CMD scripts that compiles all of the files into a single ps1, which works great with PS2EXE!

## Features:

- Easy to use UI with PS2EXE integration.
- Option to Show / Hide Console for EXE.
- Base64 your psd1 file.

### WARNING:
It is highly recommended to look over your code first before compiling to exe due to errors that could occur with how your code is written.

CLI APPS MUST HAVE **SHOW CONSOLE** CHECKED TO RUN CORRECTLY.
